## 7. Dadas las definiciones usuales de foldr y foldl, demostrar las siguientes propiedades:

### a) ∀ f :: a -> b -> b. ∀ z :: b. ∀ xs, ys :: [a]. foldr f z (xs ++ ys) = foldr f (foldr f z ys) xs

Caso base. xs = [], ys :: [a]

    foldr f z ([] ++ ys)
        = foldr f z ys                  { def. (++) }
        = foldr f (foldr f z ys) []     { def. foldr, caso base }
    .

Paso inductivo.

    Supongamos vale para xs :: [a]. Sea x :: [a], (x:xs), y :: [a]

    foldr f z ((x:xs) ++ ys)
        = foldr f z (x: (xs ++ ys))         { P1 ej. (3.h) }
        = f x (foldr f z (xs ++ ys))        { def. foldr }
        = f x (foldr f (foldr f z ys) xs)   { HI }
        = foldr f (foldr f z ys) (x:xs)     { def. foldr }
    .
.

### b) ∀ f :: b -> a -> b. ∀ z :: b. ∀ xs, ys :: [a]. foldl f z (xs ++ ys) = foldl f (foldl f z xs) ys

Caso base. xs = [], ys :: [a]

    foldl f z ([] ++ ys)
        = foldl f z ys                  { def. (++) }
        = foldl f (foldl f z []) ys     { def. foldl, caso base }
    .

Paso inductivo.

    Supongamos vale para xs :: [a]. Sea x :: a, (x:xs), ys :: [a]

    foldl f z ((x:xs) ++ ys)
        = foldr (flip f) z (reverse ((x:xs) ++ ys))                         { P1 }
        = foldr (flip f) z (reverse ys ++ reverse (x:xs))                   { P2 }
        = foldr (flip f) (foldr (flip f) z (reverse (x:xs))) (reverse ys)   { ej. (7.a) }
        = foldl f (foldr (flip f) z (reverse (x:xs))) ys                    { P1 }
        = foldl f (foldl f z (x:xs)) ys                                     { P1 }


    donde P1 == foldr f z xs = foldl (flip f) z (reverse xs) 

        Dem. vista en clase.

    donde P2 == reverse (xs ++ ys) = reverse ys ++ reverse xs

        Dem. de tarea :)
