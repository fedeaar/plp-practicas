## 6. Dadas las siguientes funciones:

```hs
     nub :: Eq a => [a] -> [a]
{N0} nub [] = []
{N1} nub (x:xs) = x : filter (\y -> x /= y) (nub xs)

     union :: Eq a => [a] -> [a] -> [a]
{U0} union xs ys = nub (xs ++ ys)

     intersect :: Eq a => [a] -> [a] -> [a]
{I0} intersect xs ys = filter (\e -> elem e ys) xs
```

### Indicar si las siguientes propiedades son verdaderas o falsas. Si son verdaderas, realizar una demostración. Si son falsas, presentar un contraejemplo.

### a) Eq a => ∀ xs :: [a]. ∀ e :: a. ∀ p :: a -> Bool. elem e xs && p e = elem e (filter p xs)

Caso base.

     elem e (filter p [])
          = elem e []              { def. filter }
          = elem e [] && p e       { def. elem, def. && }
     .

Paso inductivo.

     Asumimos vale para xs :: [a]. Considerémos x :: a, (x:xs)

     Caso (p x)

          elem e (filter p (x:xs))
               = elem e (x : filter p xs)                   { def. filter, p x }
               = e == x || elem e (filter p xs)             { def. elem }
               = e == x || (elem e xs && p e)               { HI }
               = (e == x && p x) || (elem e xs && p e)      { def. &&, p x }
               = (e == x && p e) || (elem e xs && p e)      { def. &&, e == x }
               = (e == x || elem e xs) && p e
               = elem e (x:xs) && p e
          .
     
     Caso not (p x)

          elem e (filter p (x:xs))
               = elem e (filter p xs)                       { def. filter, not p x }
               = (elem e xs && p e)                         { HI }
               = elem e (x:xs) && p e                       { def. &&, elem e xs, not p x. (e /= x) }
          .
     .
.

### b) Eq a => ∀ xs :: [a]. ∀ e :: a. elem e xs = elem e (nub xs)

Caso base.

     elem e []
          = elem e (nub [])        { N0 }
     .

Paso inductivo.

     Asumimos vale para xs :: [a]. Considerémos x :: a, (x:xs)

     elem e (nub (x:xs))
          = elem e (x : filter (\y -> x /= y) (nub xs))          { def. nub }
          = e == x || elem e (filter (\y -> x /= y) (nub xs))    { def. elem }
          = e == x || (elem e (nub xs) && x /= e)                { ej. (6.a) }
          = e == x || (elem e xs && x /= e)                      { HI }
          = e == x || elem e xs                                  { a || not a && b => a || b }
          = elem e (x:xs)                                        { def. elem }
     .
.

### c) Eq a => ∀ xs :: [a]. ∀ ys :: [a]. ∀ e :: a. elem e (union xs ys) = (elem e xs) || (elem e ys)

Caso base.

     elem e (union [] ys)
          = elem e (nub ([] ++ ys))     { U0 }
          = elem e (nub ys)             { def. (++) }
          = elem e ys                   { ej. (6.b) }
          = elem e [] || elem e ys      { def. ||, def. elem }
     .

Paso inductivo.

     Asumimos vale para xs :: [a]. Considerémos x :: a, (x:xs), ys :: [a]

     elem e (union (x:xs) ys)
          = elem e (nub ((x:xs) ++ ys))                               { def. union }
          = elem e (nub (x:(xs ++ ys)))                               { P1 ej. (3.h) }
          = elem e (x: filter (\y -> x /= y) (nub xs ++ ys))          { def. nub }
          = e == x || elem e (filter \y -> x /= y (nub (xs ++ ys)))   { def. elem }
          = e == x || (elem e (nub (xs ++ ys)) && x /= e)             { ej. (6.a) }
          = e == x || (elem e (union xs ys) && x /= e)                { def. union }
          = e == x || ((elem e xs || elem e ys) && x /= e)            { HI }
          = e == x || elem e xs || elem e ys                          { a || not a && b => a || b }
          = elem e (x:xs) || elem e ys                                { def. elem }
     .
.

### d) Eq a => ∀ xs :: [a]. ∀ ys :: [a]. ∀ e :: a. elem e (intersect xs ys) = (elem e xs) && (elem e ys)

Tenemos

elem e (intersect xs ys)
     = elem e (filter (\e -> elem e ys) xs)       { U0 }
     = (elem e xs) && ((\e -> elem e ys) e)       { ej. (6.a) }
     = (elem e xs) && (elem e ys)                 { def. \ }
.

### e) Eq a => ∀ xs :: [a]. ∀ ys :: [a]. length (union xs ys) = length xs + length ys

Contraejemplo: xs = [1], ys = [1].

length (union [1] [1])
      = length (nub ([1] ++ [1]))
      = length (nub ([1, 1]))
      = length (1 : filter (\y -> x /= y) (nub [1]))
      = length (1 : [])
      = length [1]
      = 1
     /= length [1] + length [1]
      = 1 + 1
      = 2
.

### f) Eq a => ∀ xs :: [a]. ∀ ys :: [a]. length (union xs ys) ≤ length xs + length ys

Caso base.

     length (union [] ys)
           = length (nub ([] ++ ys))     { U0 }
           = length (nub ys)             { def. (++) }
          <= length ys                   { P1 }
           = length [] + length ys      
     .

     donde P1 == length (nub ys) <= length ys

     Dem.

          Caso base.

               length (nub [])
                    = length []
               .
          
          Paso inductivo.

               length (nub (x:xs))
                     = length (x: filter (\y -> x /= y) (nub xs))     { def. nub }
                     = 1 + length (filter (\y -> x /= y) (nub xs))    { def. length }
                    <= 1 + length (nub xs)                            { P2 }
                    <= 1 + length xs                                  { HI }
                     = length (x:xs)                                  { def. length }
               .

               donde P2 == length (filter p xs) <=  length xs.

               Dem. ejercicio para el lector :)
          .
     .

Paso inductivo.

     Asumimos vale para xs :: [a]. Considerémos x :: a, (x:xs), ys :: [a]

     length (union (x:xs) ys)
           = length (nub ((x:xs) ++ ys))     { U0 }
           = length (nub (x:(xs ++ ys)))     { P1 ej. (3.h) }
           = 1 + length (nub (xs ++ ys))     { def. length }
           = 1 + length (union xs ys)        { U0 }
          <= 1 + length xs + length ys       { HI }
           = length (x:xs) + length ys       { def. length }
