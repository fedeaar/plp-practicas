## 3. Considerar las siguientes funciones:

```hs
     length :: [a] -> Int
{L0} length [] = 0
{L1} length (x:xs) = 1 + length xs

     duplicar :: [a] -> [a]
{D0} duplicar [] = []
{D1} duplicar (x:xs) = x : x : duplicar xs

     append :: [a] -> [a] -> [a]
{A0} append [] ys = ys
{A1} append (x:xs) ys = x : append xs ys

     (++) :: [a] -> [a] -> [a]
{++} xs ++ ys = foldr (:) ys xs

     ponerAlFinal :: a -> [a] -> [a]
{P0} ponerAlFinal x = foldr (:) (x:[])

     reverse :: [a] -> [a]
{R0} reverse = foldl (flip (:)) []
```

### Demostrar las siguientes propiedades.

### a) ∀ xs :: [a]. length (duplicar xs) = 2 * length xs

Lo demostramos por inducción.

Caso base. xs = []

     Tenemos,

     length (duplicar [])
          = length []              { def. duplicar }
          = 0                      { def. length }
          = 2 * 0                  { aritmetica }
          = 2 * length []          { def. length }
     .

Paso inductivo.

     Asumimos vale para xs :: [a], considerémos x :: a, (x:xs)

     length (duplicar (x:xs))
          = length (x : x : duplicar xs)     { def. duplicar }
          = 1 + length (x : duplicar xs)     { def. length }
          = 1 + 1 + length (duplicar xs)     { def. length }
          = 2 + 2 * length xs                { HI }
          = 2 * (1 + length xs)              { aritmetica }
          = 2 * (length (x:xs))              { def. length }
     .
.

### b) ∀ xs :: [a]. ∀ ys::[a]. length (append xs ys) = length xs + length ys

Lo demostramos por inducción.

Caso base. xs = []

     Tenemos,

     length (append [] ys) 
          = length ys              { def. append }
          = length [] + length ys  { def. length }
     .

Paso inductivo.

     Asumimos vale para xs :: [a], considerémos x :: a, (x:xs)

     length (append (x:xs) ys)
          = length (x : append xs ys)   { def. append }
          = 1 + length (append xs ys)   { def. length }
          = 1 + length xs + length ys   { HI }
          = length (x:xs) + length ys   { def. length }
     .
.

### c) ∀ xs :: [a]. ∀ x :: a. [x] ++ xs = x:xs

Tenemos, 

[x] ++ xs
     = foldr (:) xs [x]            { def. ++ }
     = foldr (:) xs (x:[])         { def. [] }
     = (:) x (foldr (:) xs [])     { def. foldr }
     = (:) x xs                    { def. foldr }
     = x : xs
.

### d) ∀ xs :: [a]. ∀ f :: a -> b. length (map f xs) = length xs

Lo demostramos por inducción.

Caso base. xs = []

     Tenemos,

     length (map f []) 
          = length []              { def. map }
     .

Paso inductivo.

     Asumimos vale para xs :: [a], considerémos x :: a, (x:xs)

     length (map f (x:xs))
          = length (f x : map f xs)     { def. map }
          = 1 + length (map f xs)       { def. length }
          = 1 + length xs               { HI }
          = length (x:xs)               { def. length }
     .
.

### e) ∀ xs :: [a]. ∀ p :: a -> Bool. ∀ e :: a. ((elem e (filter p xs)) => (elem e xs)) (asumiendo Eq a)

Si no se satisface (elem e (filter p xs), entonces (elem e xs) puede ser verdadero o falso y se satisface la implicación.

Consideremos entonces un predicado para el caso en que el antecedente fuerza al consecuente. Es decir, veamos que

∀ p :: a -> Bool. ∀ e :: a. tal que elem e (filter p xs) = True. ((elem e (filter p xs)) = (elem e xs))

Lo demostramos por inducción. 

Caso base. xs = []

     Tenemos, 

     elem e (filter p [])
          = elem e []              { def. filter }
     .

Paso inductivo. 

     Asumimos vale para xs :: [a], considerémos x :: a, (x:xs)

     elem e (filter p (x:xs))
          = elem e (if p x
                         then x : filter p xs
                         else filter p xs)             { def. filter }
     
     si p x,

     elem e (filter p (x:xs))
          = elem e (x : filter p xs)                   { def. if }
          = e == x || elem e (filter p xs)             { def. elem }
          = e == x || elem e xs                        { HI. }
          = elem e (x:xs)                              { def. elem }

     si not p x,

     elem e (filter p (x:xs))
          = elem e (filter p xs)                       { def. if }
          = elem e xs                                  { HI. }
          = elem e (x:xs)                              { P1 }

     donde P1 es

          elem e (filter p (x:xs)) = True y not p x 
               => elem e xs = True 
               => ∀ y :: a. elem e (y:xs) = e == y || elem e xs = True
          .
     .
.

### f) ∀ xs :: [a]. ∀ x :: a. ponerAlFinal x xs = xs ++ (x:[])

Tenemos, 

ponerAlFinal x xs
     = foldr (:) (x:[]) xs              { def. ponerAlFinal }
     = xs ++ (x:[])                     { def. ++ }
.

### g) reverse = foldr (\x rec -> rec ++ (x:[])) []

Por inducción y extensionalidad funcional.

Sea g = \x rec -> rec ++ (x:[])

Caso base. xs = []

     Tenemos, 

     reverse []
          = foldl (flip (:)) [] []                     { def. reverse }
          = []                                         { def. foldl. caso base }
          = foldr g [] []                              { def. foldr. caso base }
     .

Paso inductivo. 

     Asumimos vale para xs :: [a], considerémos x :: a, (x:xs)

     foldr g [] (x:xs)
          = g x (foldr g [] xs)                             { def. foldr }
          = (foldr g [] xs) ++ [x]                          { def. g }
          = reverse xs ++ [x]                               { HI }
          = foldr (:) [x] (reverse xs)                      { def. (++) }
          = foldl (flip (:)) [x] (reverse (reverse xs))     { P1 }
          = foldl (flip (:)) [x] xs                         { P2 }
          = foldl (flip (:)) [] (x:xs)                      { def. foldl y flip (:) }
          = reverse (x:xs)                                  { def. reverse }

     donde P1 == foldr f z xs = foldl (flip f) z (reverse xs) 

          Dem. vista en clase.

     y donde P2 == reverse (reverse xs) = xs

          Dem.

          reverse (reverse xs) 
               = foldl (flip (:)) [] (reverse xs)                { def. reverse }
               = foldr (:) [] xs                                 { prop. 1 }
               = xs ++ []                                        { def. (++) }
               = xs                                              { def. (++) }
          .
     .
.

### h) ∀ xs :: [a]. ∀ x :: a. head (reverse (ponerAlFinal x xs)) = x

Por inducción y extensionalidad funcional.

Sea g = \x rec -> rec ++ (x:[])

Tenemos

head (reverse (ponerAlFinal y (x:xs)))
     = head (reverse (foldr (:) [y] (x:xs)))      { def. ponerAlFinal }
     = head (reverse ((x:xs) ++ [y]))             { def (++) }
     = head (reverse (x : (xs ++ [y])))           { P1 }
     = head (foldr g [] ((x:xs) ++ [y]))          { def. reverse }
     = head (y : foldr g [] (x:xs))               { P2 }
     = y                                          { def. head }

     Dem.

     Caso base. xs = []

     [x] ++ ys 
          = foldr (:) ys [x]       { def. (++) }
          = x : foldr ys []        { def. foldr }
          = x : ys                 { def. foldr caso base }

     Paso inductivo. 

     Asumimos vale para xs :: [a], considerémos x :: a, (x:xs)

     (x:xs) ++ ys
          = foldr (:) ys (x:xs)    { def. (++) }
          = x : foldr (:) ys xs    { def. foldr }
          = x : (xs ++ ys)         { HI }
     .

y donde P2 == foldr g [] (xs ++ [y]) = y : foldr g [] xs

     Dem.

     Caso base. xs = []

     foldr g [] ([] ++ [y])
          = foldr g [] [y]         { def. (++) }
          = [] ++ [y]              { def. folder, g }
          = y : []                 { def. (++) }
          = y : foldr g [] []      { def. foldr, caso base }

     Paso inductivo. 

     Asumimos vale para xs :: [a], considerémos x :: a, (x:xs)

     foldr g [] ((x:xs) ++ [y])
          = foldr g [] (x : (xs ++ [y]))     { P1 }
          = foldr g [] (xs ++ [y]) ++ [x]    { def. foldr, g }
          = (y : foldr g [] xs) ++ [x]       { HI }
